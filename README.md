# Overview
This is a simple two-player dice game where each player rolls a die, and the player with the higher roll wins. The result of the game is displayed at the top of the page, indicating the victorious player.

# How It Works
Each player rolls a virtual die when the webpage is loaded or refreshed.
The dice rolls generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each player.
The player with the higher number is declared the winner.
If both players roll the same number, the game is declared a draw.
# Game Logic
Two random numbers are generated, one for each player.
Each number corresponds to a specific die image, which is displayed on the screen.
The game compares the two numbers:
If Player 1's number is higher, "Player 1 Wins!" is displayed.
If Player 2's number is higher, "Player 2 Wins!" is displayed.
If both numbers are equal, "It's a Draw!" is displayed.
# How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The game will automatically roll the dice for both players upon loading.
Refresh the page to play again.
